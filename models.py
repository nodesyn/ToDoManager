Models for the To-Do application.
If implementing a database solution, this would contain the Task model definition.

Example model for a Task:

class Task:
    def __init__(self, id, title, description="", priority="medium", completed=False):
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
        self.description = description
        self.priority = priority  # "low", "medium", "high"
        self.completed = completed
        self.created_at = datetime.now()
